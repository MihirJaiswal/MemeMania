                <h2>Skibidi Toilet</h2>
                <p>Description:Skibidi Toilet is a series of viral YouTube Shorts uploaded on the DaFuq!?Boom! channel on YouTube. The series depicts a war between the Skibidi Toilets — disembodied heads inside moving toilets which can be killed by being flushed down — and a faction of people with hardware for heads, such as cameras, loudspeakers, or televisions. Skibidi Toilet is produced by Georgian animator Alexey Gerasimov using Source Filmmaker. The first short was posted on 7 February 2023.

                    Skibidi Toilet features bizarre visuals with a nonsensical nature, a relatively short running length, and toilet humor, which became viral several months after its debut. It quickly accumulated millions of views, becoming a meme on both YouTube and TikTok. According to Tubefilter, "DaFuq!?Boom!" was the most viewed YouTube channel during June 2023.</p>

                <h2>Zoolander meme</h2>
                <p>The Zoolander stare is the first Zoolander meme that blew up this year and ultimately plays on the lightskin stare meme that labeled lightskinned Black men as having God-level unspoken rizz. It started with one TikTok uploaded on November 28th and used a clip from the movie's opening scene when Ben Stiller's character Derek Zoolander sees Owen Wilson's character Hansel on the red carpet.

                    Additionally, the song used in the "Zoolander stare" meme is a mashup of the songs "Who Is She?" by I Monster and "The Perfect Girl" by Mareux.</p>
